# Integrating Your App with n8n Workflows

To ensure your app can interact with n8n workflows and to build a custom integration, you’ll need to align your app with n8n’s architecture. n8n is an open-source workflow automation tool that uses nodes as modular components to trigger events or perform actions. A custom integration can mean creating a custom node or leveraging n8n’s existing nodes (e.g., HTTP Request or Webhook). Below is a step-by-step guide to building your integration:

## Understand n8n’s Integration Model

Nodes as Building Blocks: Integrations in n8n are driven by nodes, which handle specific actions (e.g., API calls) or triggers (e.g., webhooks).

API-Driven: n8n communicates with external services via APIs, so your app will need a RESTful API or webhook support.

Options: You can either build a custom node or use n8n’s generic nodes for quick integration.

## Decide on the Integration Approach

You have two main options based on your needs and expertise:

### Option A: Use Existing n8n Nodes (Simpler, Faster)

Webhook Node: Use this if your app can push data to n8n (e.g., via POST requests) to trigger workflows.

- HTTP Request Node: Use this if your app has an API that n8n can call to pull data or send commands.
  - Pros: No custom coding, fast setup, leverages n8n’s flexibility.
  - Cons: Limited to generic features, no custom UI or branding.

### Option B: Build a Custom Node (More Control, Advanced)

- Custom Node Development: Create a dedicated node for your app, offering a tailored experience in n8n.
  - Pros: Seamless UX, reusable by the community, fully customized to your app.
  - Cons: Requires Node.js skills and more time.

Recommendation: Start with Option A to validate, then move to Option B for a deeper integration.

## Prepare Your App

Before integrating, ensure your app is n8n-ready:

- Expose an API: Provide REST endpoints (e.g., /data, /events) that n8n can interact with.
- Webhook Support: Enable your app to send real-time events to n8n if needed.
- Authentication: Support API keys, OAuth2, or other methods n8n can use.

## Build the Integration
If Using Existing Nodes (Option A)
Set Up a Webhook in n8n:
Create a workflow and add a Webhook node (under Triggers).

Configure it for POST requests and copy the test URL (e.g., http://localhost:5678/webhook-test/abc123).

Send a test payload from your app (e.g., via curl).

Build the workflow to process the data.

Call Your App’s API:
Add an HTTP Request node.

Set the endpoint (e.g., https://yourapp.com/api/data), method (GET/POST), and authentication (e.g., API key).

Test the workflow.

If Building a Custom Node (Option B)
Set Up Development Environment:
Install Node.js (v16+) and npm.

Install n8n: npm install n8n -g.

Clone the n8n-nodes-starter repo.

Create Your Node:
Write the node logic in JavaScript. Example:
```javascript
async execute() {
  const response = await this.helpers.httpRequest({
    url: 'https://yourapp.com/api/data',
    method: 'GET',
    headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${this.getCredentials('apiKey')}` },
  });
  return [{ json: response }];
}
```

Define credentials and parameters in the node’s description.

Test Locally:
Run npm install and npm run build.

Copy the built node to ~/.n8n/custom/ and restart n8n.

Verify it appears in n8n’s node panel.

Publish (Optional):
Package as an npm module (npm publish) and share with the community.

## 5. Test and Iterate

- End-to-End Testing: Run workflows to confirm data flows correctly.
- Edge Cases: Test invalid inputs, rate limits, and downtime scenarios.
- Debugging: Use n8n’s execution history for troubleshooting.

## 6. Deploy and Scale

- Hosting: Use n8n Cloud or self-host (e.g., docker run -p 5678:5678 n8nio/n8n).
- Security: Secure APIs with HTTPS and proper authentication.
- Documentation: Write a guide for users to set up your integration.

## Best Practices

- Start Small: Use webhooks or HTTP requests first, then expand.
- Leverage Docs: Check n8n’s documentation for guidance.
- Community Resources: Explore n8n’s 400+ integrations and 900+ templates.
- Modularity: Focus on specific tasks (e.g., “send event”) rather than large workflows.

## Recommendation

For a quick start, use Option A (existing nodes) to connect your app to n8n. For a polished, reusable solution—especially for broader use—build a custom node (Option B). This approach ensures flexibility and scalability.
